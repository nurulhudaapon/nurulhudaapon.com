        I started programming in 2019, near the end of high school. Around the same time, I started my professional
        career as a QA Engineer. I've grown with the same company and now working as a Staff Engineer.

      <p>Working full-time while studying is tough, but it has taught me good time management and how to keep going.</p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy learning about new technologies. I'm a friendly person who likes meeting new people,
        but I can also be a bit quiet.
